Numerical Lexicographical String Sort
=====================================

The idea here was to take an array of strings, assigning every character a value: `a = 1, b = 2` and so on. Then sort the array by which string has the highest sum of its characters.

If two separate strings share the same value they should be ordered in the array Lexicographically.

The resulting array is then output from the method.
